                  BFC Capital has been providing financial services and products
                  to its clients for over two decades. Currently, the company
                  has over 16,000 retail clients and manages an AUM of more than
                  Rs. 9 Billion+. Because we understand the importance of
                  financial matters, additional efforts are put in to assess all
                  clients' financial obligations, aspirations, and risk profiles
                  before laying out a plan to help them achieve the kind of
                  wealth they desire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  BFC Capital operates under a precise mechanism designed to
                  facilitate real-time monitoring and manoeuvring of
                  investments. In addition, each client's portfolio is
                  scrutinised for bad investments twice a year to rebalance the
                  weight of all underlying assets and maintain the desired level
                  of risk distribution.

                  A laser-sharp focus, a proactive intellect, and a reassuring
                  demeanour are required when managing a team as dynamic and
                  diverse as Team BFC. Fortunately for us, Vikas is all of that
                  and more. In his words, it's more about the will and less
                  about the skill. We couldn't agree more!
