                  Mutual Funds are among the best investment options out there
                  because of their inherent versatility, so much so that they
                  are a good fit for seasoned and new investors alike. However,
                  the same versatility makes identifying the best mutual fund
                  schemes tricky. That said, it can still be done with some
                  proper, first-hand research.

                      <p>
                        A Mutual Fund is a financial vehicle constituted by an
                        Asset Management Company (AMC) after compiling the
                        corpus accumulated through the contributions of several
                        investors who have similar investment goals. Thereafter,
                        the AMC onboards a fund manager for fulfilling the
                        investment objective. The fund manager is tasked with
                        investing the accumulated money across asset classes to
                        earn gains on the investor’s behalf.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In simpler terms, Mutual Funds are an individual’s entry
                        ticket to professionally managed portfolios that
                        comprise all sorts of financial assets, including
                        equities, bonds, and other securities. Consequently, the
                        investor becomes a stakeholder in the gains manifested
                        by the fund over time.

                        Want to buy a new car 5 years from now? With Mutual
                        Funds, you just might be able to compound the needed
                        corpus with time to spare. Or maybe you are thinking
                        long term and want to save for retirement or to buy a
                        house. Regardless, the asset class you invest your money
                        in should have the potential to match inflation rates,
                        if not beat them, and simultaneously override any market
                        fluctuations.

                        Rupee cost averaging, compounding, and diversification,
                        this trifecta alone ensures that the money parked in
                        Mutual Funds appreciates expeditiously to meet your
                        financial goals, and no unforeseen factor eats into the
                        gains you have made. Also, certain schemes can help you
                        save approximately Rs. 46,800 in tax in case you need
                        more reasons to invest in Mutual Funds.

                      <p>
                        Some of the many advantages of investing in Mutual
                        Funds:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>1.</b> Mutual Funds allow wealth creation with small
                        contributions through SIPs. Also, SIPs override market
                        volatility over the long term by purchasing additional
                        units in a dipping market.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>2.</b> Online access allows real-time monitoring of
                        fund performance. Moreover, there is no lock-in under
                        open-ended Mutual Funds, making them a very liquid
                        investment.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>3.</b> Mutual Funds invest money across asset
                        classes, which neutralizes risks, as one asset class can
                        compensate for any dip in returns witnessed by another.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>4.</b> Individuals can invest in Mutual Funds that
                        suit their purpose. This allows them to achieve their
                        goals in a calculated manner.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>5.</b> Certain equity-linked schemes offer tax
                        benefits, wherein the investor can save up to Rs. 46,800
                        in tax.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>6.</b> The possibility of non-compliance in Mutual
                        Funds is negligible as they are monitored by SEBI and
                        AMFI. Also, SEBI takes regular steps to ensure investor
                        interest is protected and all possible benefits are
                        passed on to them.

                        <b>Equity Mutual Funds:</b> Equity funds primarily
                        invest in stocks. You invest your money in the fund via
                        an SIP or in a lumpsum which then invests it in various
                        equity stocks on your behalf. The consequent gains or
                        losses accrued in the portfolio affect your fund's Net
                        Asset Value (NAV).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Debt Mutual Funds:</b> Debt funds (also known as a
                        fixed-income fund) invest a significant portion of your
                        money in fixed-income securities like government
                        securities, debentures, corporate bonds and other
                        money-market instruments.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b>Hybrid Mutual Funds:</b> Hybrid funds invest in both
                        debt and equity instruments to achieve diversification
                        and avoid the concentration risk. A perfect blend of the
                        two offers higher returns than a regular debt fund
                        without being as risky as equity funds. The choice of a
                        hybrid fund depends on your risk preferences and
                        investment objective.
