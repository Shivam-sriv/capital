                    Why should I associate with BFC and not with a Leading Bank

                    Promoting Mutual Funds or any other third-party financial
                    product is an extended task for banks. They usually leverage
                    the investor confidence they enjoy and make extra revenue by
                    selling such products. BFC Capital works on the philosophy
                    of providing customised financial solutions instead of
                    selling a financial product for want of revenue. On the
                    basis of this, we, over the last 20-odd years, have built a
                    twelve thousand-strong retail client base. We try to provide
                    our clients with insights to protect them from any probable
                    financial harm and give them the support necessary to make
                    informed investment decisions. We understand that money
                    matters are sensitive and give our investors the personal
                    care they deserve, from periodic portfolio reviews to
                    financial solutions tailored to match investor obligations.
                    This is why today, we are one of the leading wealth
                    management companies in the region.

                    BFC Capital is an intermediary facilitating

                    and manage our clients' investments, we do not have access
                    to the money they invest. The industry structure does not
                    leave any scope for mismanagement of funds, meaning the
                    money invested from an investor's bank account is
                    automatically credited in the respective fund/scheme's
                    account and vice-versa, with no scope for third-party
                    intrusion.
