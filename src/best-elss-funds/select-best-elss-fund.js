                ELSS funds have a lock-in period, which means there is little an
                investor can do if his funds are parked in the wrong scheme,
                which is why when it comes to investing in ELSS plans, seeking
                professional assistance is the only way to go. Each investor
                must be isolated and diagnosed separately for obligations and
                liabilities before a financial solution can be tailored to their
                specific needs.

                Herein, the first step is to prioritise. Among other things, one
                must be clear on their investment goal; is it simply to save
                money on taxes, or are they aiming for a specific volume of
                gains? In addition, the amount they wish to accumulate, the
                duration of their investment, and the estimated tax outgo must
                all be considered. These variables must be communicated to the
                professional assisting the investor in order to shortlist an
                ELSS plan compatible with the former's risk profile.
