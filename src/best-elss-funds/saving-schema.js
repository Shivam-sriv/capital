                Many features make ELSS Funds an ideal investment option for
                investors, be it people looking to save money on tax or those
                eyeing a specific goal. Let's look at some of their noteworthy
                features.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  ELSS Funds invest at least 80 per cent of their corpus in
                  equity and equity-related instruments, making them a
                  high-yielding asset class.
                </li>
                <li>
                  ELSS mutual funds have a mandatory lock-in period of 3 years,
                  meaning the investor cannot liquidate units from the ELSS plan
                  until the conclusion of the lock-in period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  ELSS funds also do not have any upper investment limit,
                  although the minimum investment threshold tends to vary across
                  fund houses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  ELSS Funds qualify for tax deductions listed under Section 80
                  C of the Income Tax Act. Investors are eligible for a tax
                  deduction of up to Rs. 1,50,000 on investments, saving up to
                  Rs. 46,800 on taxes yearly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  ELSS schemes are open-ended, meaning there is no upper limit
                  to the time duration one can remain invested in an ELSS
                  scheme.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The gains made through ELSS funds are tax exempted up to Rs.
                  1,00,000. Gains made over and above this threshold are taxed
                  at 10 per cent.
                </li>
