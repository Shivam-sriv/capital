                Given the number of economic influences and vulnerabilities the
                equity market is susceptible to, it is advisable that all
                fundamentals fuelling an ELSS schemeâ€™s growth be observed
                closely and scrutinised for irregularities or flaws in
                compounding strategy before investing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Investors also need to assure that the underlying funds of the
                ELSS scheme in their portfolio are monitored and switched if
                required to avoid any kickbacks from the global market. Also,
                the tax benefits offered under the scheme and the quantum of
                investment should be sufficient to accommodate the tax liability
                the investor is to attract.
              </p>
              <p>
                In simple terms, the best ELSS Funds are those that match
                investment objectives and do not compromise on returns on the
                pretext of offering tax benefits.
