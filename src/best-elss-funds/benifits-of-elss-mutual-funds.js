                There are multiple Benefits of Investing in ELSS Mutual Funds.
                Listed below are some of those-
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Tax Saving </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the primary benefits of investing in ELSS mutual funds is
                tax saving. ELSS schemes enjoy tax benefits listed under Section
                80C of the Income Tax Act. As per the governing provisions,
                investors can claim a tax deduction of up to Rs 1,50,000 a year
                by investing in ELSS schemes, saving up to Rs 46,800 a year on
                taxes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Better Post-Tax Returns</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Long-term capital gains made from ELSS are tax-free up to a
                limit of Rs. 1,00,000. Also, gains made over and above this
                limit are taxed at 10% only. In short, lower tax rates and
                higher returns ensure the best-possible post-tax returns.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>High Returns</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Inherently, ELSS investments are vulnerable to market
                fluctuations. However, this vulnerability can be used to the
                investor's advantage if the investment is given enough time to
                grow in the market. Over time, ELSS funds benefit from
                compounding laws and produce higher returns.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Multiple Investment Modes</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Investors can enter ELSS schemes in one go by making a one-time
                lump sum investment, or they can invest in portions through
                regular monthly contributions via an SIP plan. This
                "flexibility" is what makes ELSS schemes an investor favourite.
