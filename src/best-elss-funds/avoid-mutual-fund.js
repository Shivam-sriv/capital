                The best investment plans are those that offer consistent
                returns over the long term. Sometimes, however, the ELSS schemes
                topping the charts descend the rankings and never recover,
                meaning they're inconsistent performers. The fact that ELSS
                plans come with a 3-year lock-in period only compounds the
                problem, as the investor cannot salvage the money parked in the
                fund for the time being. So, it is safe to assume that there are
                other parameters besides previous yields to shortlist ELSS funds
                for investment.
