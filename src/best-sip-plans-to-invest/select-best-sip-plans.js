                  Learning how to select the Best SIP Plans starts with
                  identifying and acknowledging shortcomings in investors’
                  capabilities. Individual investors, more often than not, find
                  themselves at the wrong end of the market because of lack of
                  knowledge and active involvement.

                  Reliance on half-cooked research and previous growth
                  trajectories proves detrimental in such cases. As already
                  established, the scope of the research needed for identifying
                  suitable SIP schemes goes beyond the capabilities of the
                  average investor.

                  The truth is that there is no readymade solution for selecting
                  SIP plans. Each investor's needs are unique, so solutions must
                  be tailored to match individual needs. This is where BFC
                  Capital comes in.

                  Now, let’s move on and learn, How to Select the Best SIP Plans
                  ?

                  Ideally, investors should start by getting their priorities in
                  order. They should have clear understanding about their
                  purpose for investing in an SIP, be it for buying a house, or
                  just building much-needed wealth. All such relevant
                  information must be discussed with the professional helping
                  them identify appropriate SIP Plans, including their risk
                  appetite, the tenure of investment they are targeting and the
                  targeted corpus, among other things, so a scheme can be
                  shortlisted accordingly.
