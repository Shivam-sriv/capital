                SIPs help investors create long-term wealth, but other than

                <b>Rupee Cost Averaging</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the inherent features of SIPs is Rupee Cost Averaging. It
                allows investors to invest a predetermined amount of money at
                regular intervals irrespective of the market conditions,
                consequently, helping them purchase additional units in a
                dipping market, bringing down the average per unit cost in the
                long run.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Flexibility</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                SIP mutual funds provide investors with much-needed flexibility.
                Investors can start, top-up, pause or cancel their SIP
                investments as they please.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Power of Compounding</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                SIP investments are intended to be held for a long time, and
                since they work on the principle of compounding, they benefit
                investors in the long-run. Regular investments compound over
                time, resulting in higher returns for investors. One can also
                use an
                <a

                <b>Pocket-Friendly Investment</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                SIP Mutual Funds are pretty pocket friendly and do not burn
                holes in an investor's pocket. Investors can start an SIP with
                as little as Rs.100 a month. Such small contributions do not
                strain the investor's budget and can yield great returns if
                allowed sufficient time to grow.
