                The biggest mistake newbie investors make is investing in an SIP
                based on previous yields. Investors need to understand, an SIP’s
                previous performance does not ensure consistent upward
                trajectory moving forward, in terms of the returns fetched.
              </p>
              <p>
                See, every investor has a different set of liabilities and
                obligations, making his or her investment agenda unique.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consequently, an SIP that suits a youngster looking to build a
                corpus expeditiously by adopting an ambitious compounding
                strategy, may not be fit for a salaried individual aiming to
                accumulate wealth for his post retirement needs. The Best SIP
                Plans are those that are in line with investors’ priorities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Simply put, SIPs cannot be identified based on generic
                parameters. Unfortunately, most unsuspecting investors opt for
                one-size-fits-all plans, which most definitely is a step in the
                wrong direction and can yield disastrous results.
              </p>
              <p>
                Choosing SIPs requires detailed scrutiny of aspects that can
                affect its returns, both in the long and short-term. Those
                successful in doing so usually end up investing in plans that
                are best for them, and not for the entity pushing for their
                purchase.
