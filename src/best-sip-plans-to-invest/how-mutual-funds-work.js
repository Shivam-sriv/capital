                Investments in SIP mutual funds are made at regular intervals,
                i.e. weekly, monthly or quarterly. Investors must predetermine
                an amount they are willing to invest in the SIP, and that amount
                will be auto-debited from their account on the specified date
                upon their standing instruction. After that, the investor will
                be assigned a corresponding number of mutual fund units,
                determined by the current Net Asset Value (NAV) of the plan.
