                  SIP Mutual Funds allow investors the freedom to start wealth
                  accumulation with as little as Rs.100 a month, and

                  can yield considerable returns if allowed sufficient time to
                  grow. However, there are certain pointers one should look at

                  Although investing in mutual funds through SIP is advisable
                  for all individuals, it is an ideal investment option for
                  young investors. Young investors have enough time on their
                  hands and have a high-risk appetite that allows them to stay
                  invested for an extended period and taste better returns.

                  SIPs are an ideal wealth accumulating tool for investors with
                  long-term goals because they tend to yield better returns when
                  given enough time to grow. They help investors achieve their
                  investment objectives much faster, be it retirement planning,
                  child marriage planning, etc. That said, people with
                  short-term goals like those planning a trip or saving up for a
                  laptop can also opt for SIP plans.

                  Investors looking for an alternate source of income at the
                  time of retirement can always choose SIPs. Investors can
                  automate their withdrawal by opting for an SWP (Systematic
                  Withdrawal Plan) and ensure a steady passive income post
                  retirement. Under SWPs, investors can liquidate a
                  predetermined volume of units from their accumulated corpus at
                  regular intervals and receive the liquidated amount in their
                  bank accounts.
