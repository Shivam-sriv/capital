                Many investors make the mistake of investing in Mutual Fund
                schemes based on previous returns. Investors should refrain from
                investing in table-topper funds, simply because the first-hand
                research required to identify suitable schemes goes beyond
                comparing previous returns.

                It is worth noting that top mutual funds keep changing on a
                daily basis, across categories, depending upon market highs and
                lows. Meaning, the mutual fund presently topping the charts may
                not make top 10 the very next day or week. Therefore, investing
                in a scheme just because of its ranking is a flawed approach.
                Mutual Funds should only be shortlisted after thorough research,
                that too by someone who knows what he/she is doing.
