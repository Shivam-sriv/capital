                Mutual Funds are invested in various asset classes, due to which
                they are susceptible to market fluctuations. These market
                fluctuations can lead to potential losses; therefore, analyzing
                the risks associated with investing in mutual funds is
                necessary. Listed below are the risks that accompany mutual
                funds.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Market Risk</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Market risk arises due to the underperformance of the market,
                which could lead to losses for mutual fund investors. Several
                reasons can be responsible for the poor performance, like a
                pandemic, global slowdown, inflation, and so on, making life
                difficult for investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Concentration Risk</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Concentration basically means focusing on one thing, and so does
                concentration risk. When mutual fund schemes invest their entire
                accumulated corpus in one asset class, the risk factor is
                greater. The best way to avoid such threats is diversifying the
                portfolio. The more spread out the portfolio, the lesser at risk
                it shall be.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Interest Rate Risk</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The fluctuation in a debt fund's NAV due to changes in interest
                rates is known as Interest Rate Risk. Whenever interest rates
                rise, debt funds experience an drop in their NAV, meaning the
                two are inversely related.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Liquidity Risk</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Liquidity risk refers to the inability to redeem units from a
                mutual fund scheme. This usually happens when a seller is unable
                to find a buyer for the security or when the investment is made
                in an ELSS scheme that has a mandatory three-year lock-in
                period.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Credit Risk</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                When the issuer of a bond purchased is unable to pay the
                promised interest it is referred to as Credit Risk. Investors
                can evaluate credit risk by analyzing the credit ratings awarded
                to the scheme by credit rating agencies.
