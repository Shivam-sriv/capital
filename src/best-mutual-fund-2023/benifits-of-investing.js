                Ultimately, everyone wants to invest in an asset class that
                offers manifold returns, which is why Mutual Funds are
                investors' favourites. There are just too many benefits of
                investing in the Best Mutual Funds. Read on to find out:

              </p>
              <p>
                Mutual Funds are managed by qualified fund managers, each backed
                by a team of analysts to research the market and predict its ups
                and downs, saving the investors the trouble of managing their
                finances.

                <b>Pocket-friendly Investing</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Mutual fund investments are easy on the pocket, and investors
                can accumulate considerable wealth by investing in Systematic
                Investment Plans (SIPs). Consequently, they don't have to make
                unnecessary sacrifices to accommodate the investment. And the
                best part is that they can figure out the amount they need to
                invest for a specific objective using an{" "}

                <b>Automatic Diversification</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Mutual funds invest their accumulated corpus in various assets,
                allowing investors the luxury of diversifying, bringing down
                their risk liability whilst maximizing the returns they earn.{" "}

                <b>Healthy Returns</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Mutual funds work on the principles of compounding and thus have
                the potential to show exponentional growth over the long term.
                Simply put, the more time the invested money spends in the
                market, the more it is likely to grow.

              <p>
                <b>Ready Liquidity</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Liquidity is the ease with which an individual can convert an
                investment into cash. Mutual Funds facilitate quick redemptions,
                meaning an investor can easily redeem units from his mutual fund
                scheme online or offline. The liquidated units are transferred
                to the investorâ€™s bank account within a few days.

                <b>Tax Efficiency</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Certain Mutual Fund schemes (ELSS Plans) offer tax benefits
                under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Along with this, under
                such schemes, investors are also eligible for a yearly tax
                exemption of up to Rs. 1 Lakh on LTCG (Long term Capital Gains).
                However, if the gains exceed the Rs. 1 Lakh threshold, the
                investors are liable to pay LTCG tax at a mere 10%.
