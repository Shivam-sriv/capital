                  So, how does one identify the Best Mutual Funds for 2024? Does
                  such a thing even exist ?
                </p>
                <p>
                  To be honest, best Mutual Funds could be a thing if the
                  investor has access to the right advice, and the will to act
                  on it, and a myth, if not. See, there are no readymade “best”
                  Mutual Fund schemes. Variables such as investor priorities,
                  monetary liabilities, income levels, investment objectives,
                  etc, need to be factored in to diagnose if a certain mutual
                  fund plan can fit into an individual’s scheme of things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every investor is unique, and so are their objectives.
                  Therefore, their priorities, monetary liabilities, income
                  levels, objectives, etc., must be taken into account before
                  opting for a Mutual Fund scheme. For instance, a 25-year-old
                  looking to purchase a car can entertain the thought of chasing
                  returns since he has time and age on his side. Consequently,
                  he can invest in relatively ambitious schemes to achieve the
                  targeted corpus much before the intended deadline. A
                  homemaker, on the other hand, who just wants to keep safe the
                  money she has saved over time, may not want to be that
                  adventurous, and therefore would opt for a scheme that offers
                  consistent returns whilst keeping her invested corpus intact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Simply put, the best Mutual Funds schemes are those that are
                  in alignment with the investor’s objectives, limitations and
                  goals.
