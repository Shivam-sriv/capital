                There are no "best" mutual fund schemes for the simple reason
                that each individual's needs are unique. A scheme that works
                well for one investor may not work well for another.
              </p>

                Consider a service class investor nearing retirement. In all
                likelihood, such an investor will prefer to invest in a scheme
                that promises to preserve his capital while providing him with
                much-needed returns. A younger professional, on the other hand,
                will have more time on his side, allowing him to be more
                adventurous in his investment strategy and pursue higher
                returns.

                Prioritizing is the best way to start shortlisting mutual funds
                for investment. Among other things, one must gain clarity on
                their investment purpose, the amount they need to set aside for
                this purpose, and the duration for which they can stay invested.
                These variables must be communicated to the professional
                assisting the investor in shortlisting a mutual fund scheme so
                the latter can outline a compatible investment plan.
